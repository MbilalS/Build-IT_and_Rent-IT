We are using integration flows to get plants from RentIt, for now only one RentIt is connected. 

Site Engineer will query the plants and once he selected the plant, PHR with status pending_approval 

RentIT SiteEngineer can accept and reject PHR, if he rejects we are using REST Template to access RentIt and Purchase Order Will be created. 

RentIT employee do have Front end to either reject or accept the PO. In both cases the BuiltIn will be notify via RestTemplate.
