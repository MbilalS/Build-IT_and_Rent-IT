# Build-IT_and_Rent-IT
Java spring boot and vue.js based project

Developed two Java-based applications “Build-IT and Rent-IT” using Java, Spring framework, Vue.js, Docker, Service and API design, Domain-driven design, REST, in an enterprise environment. It’s a team-based project and my responsibilities are to develop two frontends for both applications, (rest APIs, assemblers, modeling domain model and repositories with SQL queries) on Rent-IT side, and writing unit tests.
